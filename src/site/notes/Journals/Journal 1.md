# Begin a Session

**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

  * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
  * Review or recap what happened last session.
  * Set the scene by envisioning your characterâ€™s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your characterâ€™s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

>  ðŸŽ²: **Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view**

**Terminus region, Kronos Abyss sector, somewhere near the Vesperi Drift**

There was a faint near-invisible ripple in space as the [[NPCs/Stellar Hawk\|Stellar Hawk]] popped out of the Vesperi Drift. 

At first sight, it is a strange looking starship compared to the ones usually seen around the Terminus. There are some odd organic-looking barnacles that seem to shimmer in hues spanning the spectrum. The interplay of the dark fuliginous hull and the luminescent barnacles give the Stellar Hawk a unique look. The placement of the barnacles seemed to be random but looks to be deliberate patterning.  ^6d1351

"Vuldar, wake up... wake up Vuldar" 

Circe's incessant nagging finally woke up Vuldar from a restless sleep.

"Vuldar, wake up... wake up Vuldar" 

"I'm awake. Are we there yet?" said Vuldar straightening up from the command chair he was having a nap in.

"No. Not yet. We are still on the outskirts the anchorage ring. Maybe a couple of hours." 

"Then why?", said Vuldar.

"As soon as we dropped out of the Vesperi Drift, I noticed an anomaly. Looks like something large blew up a few hours back. I picked up the aftermath radiation when we jumped out of the drift. Not sure of what it was, but it did put out a lot of radiation."

"Is it something that we should be worried about?"

"I don't think so."

"If it is nothing to worry about, I wonder why you woke me up.", Vuldar grinned and continued, " I'm going to continue my nap. Wake me up in an hour."

"Yes, Boss", came a reply with a hint of amusement.

Vuldar tried getting back to sleep and jump back into that half-forgotten dream. Usually the hum of the ship and the unnoticeable gentle yawing usually lulled him back to sleep. But not today. 

Unspooling from the command chair, he made his way down to the galley for a quick chug of kafa. Vuldar wondered how much had things changed in Vesper since his last visit a couple of years back. 

A quick check of his command bracelet alerted him that the e-drives were at three-fourths capacity. 
Vuldar thought: 'Hmm, that should mean a quick stop at Vesper once I drop off these supplies. The DERS seemed to be living up to expectations.'

"Circe", he called out," Can you check if our drift energy recovery systems are okay? Would we need to replace a few when we resupply at [[Locations/Vesper\|Vesper]]?"

Circe immediately chimed back, "I've already checked them. There are a couple of units that seemed to be overloaded and have gone white. We might want to have them checked. I've added it to the task list."

She added, "We are nearing Vesper."

Vesper had always looked like a top to Vuldar, a top-heavy and skinny-bottomed spinner. Vesper was known for its mining operations and Vuldar could see several mining rigs and a few transport ships moving in and out of the Vesperi zone.

"Stellar Hawk, You are cleared for docking. Please proceed to docking station, HL-384.", came a voice on the comms. And then added, "Welcome to Vesper."

As Circe guided the ship to its dock, Vuldar checked his PC for any new messages. There was just one. One from Bruna the Mole asking him to meet him at The Weary Miner in an hour's time. 

"Circe, can you send Bruna a message saying that I can meet her in two hour's time with my apologies for my tardiness?"

"Sure, Boss. I've got it", came a reply.

"What's with this new boss thing recently? Never mind." said Vuldar as he made his way down the ladder to the exit and on to the street level of Vesper.

Vuldar wasn't really in a hurry to get to his meet with Bruna. He didn't really want to meet with her except for the fact that he was supposed to be handing over a data dump to her. 

Vuldar slowly made his way to The Weary Miner taking in the sights and sounds of a bustling settlement life. Having spent the past few months cooped up in the Stellar Hawk, it felt great to be out in spaces that could hold more than a few people walking abreast.

He found himself at the door of The Weary Miner before he knew it. 

Bruna spotted him before he was a few steps in. She beckoned to him to follow her to a corner booth.

"Do you have it?" she queried even before he could slide into his seat.

"Good to see you too and yes, I have it."

Vuldar slid a data disk across the table. Bruna quickly gathered it up and pocketed the disk.

"So how are you doing, Mantis?", said Bruna making an air quote at his call sign.

Vuldar just shrugged and did a wriggle with his hands to indicate it was ok. 

"Where are you off to next?", Bruna asked.

"I have no idea. It has been a long journey and I wanted some R&R time.", Vuldar replied.

"Not sure Vesper is the right place for some downtime!"















Vesper, the orbital station has a worrying trouble: The air scrubbers have been tampered with.  
Vuldar is looking for a new job.
Althea Arden, a researcher at Vesper wants a piece of equipment to replace the air scrubbers. She posts a Help Wanted poster in the network.Â 
Vuldar volunteers and swears an Iron vow: travel to Aegis

# Swear an Iron Vow

**When you swear upon iron to complete a quest**, write your vow and give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next. Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.
