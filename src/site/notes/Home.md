# Welcome to The Forge

In [Ironsworn:Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged), you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

Starforged is a standalone sci-fi follow-up to Shawn Tomkin's free [Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/products-ironsworn) that has the Forge as the main setting.

> [[The Forge\|The Forge]] is a globular cluster in orbit around your people’s home galaxy. It is 1,700 light years above the galactic plane—a bright island in a dark void. (from *pg 20, Ironsworn:Starforged*)


## Campaigns

> I'm approaching it as an exercise in building my narrative and storytelling skills. I'll separate the narrative from the mechanical game play but I will try to tie them together so that they makes sense as a play report.
