# Welcome to The Forge

In [Ironsworn:Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged), you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

Starforged is a standalone sci-fi follow-up to Shawn Tomkin's free [Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/products-ironsworn) that has the Forge as the main setting.

> The Forge is a globular cluster in orbit around your people’s home galaxy. It is 1,700 light years above the galactic plane—a bright island in a dark void.
> Interstellar nebula span the depths of the Forge, interspersed with denser clouds of vibrant interplanetary dust and strange energies. It is a chaotic galaxy wracked by fiery stellar storms and unpredictable gravitational currents. The planets and stars of this place are born of that chaos. (pg 20, IS:SF)
